      /*

Lets talk about Conditional ternary operator in javascript

        ternary operator work same as if condition but the syntax is totally different
        and you are not able to write multiple condiitons in that.

        syntax
        var a;
        (condition)? a = '': a ='';
        docuemnt,write(a); 

*/
      var a = 20;
      var b;
      b = a <= 20 ? "True" : "False";
      document.write(b + "<br>");

      // there is another way to write this
      var A = 30;
      var B;
      A < 10 ? (B = "True") : (B = "false");
      document.write(B);
