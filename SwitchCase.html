      /*
            Now lets talk about the swithc cases in javascript

            whats is a switch case?
            The switch statement executes a block of code depending on different cases. 
            The switch statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, 
            which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
            Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.

            Syntax
            Switch(expression){
                case condition1 : statment()
                break;          
                case condition2 : statment()
                break;
                case condition3 : statment()
                break;
                defualt : statment()

            }

            Note :
            in expression you right an expression and case condition you check the cases
            and in any of the following case is true the statment that case will print and
            the others case are not check.

          break;
        default:
